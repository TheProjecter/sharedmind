= Getting Started =

== Starting Collaboration Plug-in ==

  # Run FreeMind.
  # Save the active map. SharedMind does not allow unnamed map.
  # Go to Tools > Start Collaboration Mode or press Alt+B. http://sharedmind.googlecode.com/files/startCollaborationScreenshot.png
  # Fill in user id and port to be used then press Login. SharedMind uses 2 ports, the port number to be used is the one filled in login window and the next port number (ex: for example as shown in the picture, the port number 1111 and 1112 will be used), so remember to open these 2 ports. http://sharedmind.googlecode.com/files/loginWindowScreenshoot.png
